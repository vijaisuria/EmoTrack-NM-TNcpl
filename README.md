# üåü EmoTrack: Multimodal Bilingual Emotion Sensing and Privacy-Preserving Analysis

## üéØ Problem Statement

EmoTrack sets out to transform emotion analysis in text data. Our mission is to create an application capable of analyzing diverse text inputs, such as social media posts and messages, to discern the writer's mood or emotional state. This involves collecting text data, preprocessing it for sentiment analysis, training advanced models to recognize emotions, and seamlessly integrating this functionality into an intuitive application interface.

## üöÄ Objectives

1. **Bilingual Text Analysis**: Develop algorithms for analyzing text in multiple languages, enabling global emotion sensing.
2. **Multi-modal Data Processing**: Implement mechanisms to process diverse data types, including text, images, and audio, for comprehensive emotion analysis.
3. **Fine-grained Emotion Recognition**: Train models to recognize nuanced emotions, capturing subtle variations in human expression.
4. **Real-time Emotion Detection**: Enable real-time analysis of emotions, providing instantaneous insights into users' emotional states.
5. **Visual Emotion Representation**: Utilize visual aids to represent emotions, enhancing user comprehension and engagement.
6. **Privacy-preserving Emotion Analysis**: Implement robust encryption techniques to protect users' data privacy while performing emotion analysis.
